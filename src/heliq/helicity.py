"""
The helicity of an objct can be analyzed in different ways. The main method
presented in our paper is to calculate the helicity function
(``helicity_function``), which gives the helicity as a function of the distance
between the helical axis and the inclination angle. It is also possible to get
the total helicity (``total_helicity``), which is a single value between -1 and
+1 that indicates the total helicity of an object based on the results of the
helicity function.

If you want to analyze the distribution of helical features across an object,
you can use ``helicity_map``, which returns an array that indicates the local
helicity around each voxel. Use ``helicity_descriptor`` for more controll about
how to calculate this helicity map, this function is internally used by
``helicity_function`` and ``helicity_descriptor`` and returns two arrays: one
array containing the magnitude of helicity (i.e. the gradient magnitude) in
each voxel and one array containing the inclination angle. That way, you can
select for example only the parts of your object that have a certain
inclination angle.
